# Contrast Project API Reverse Engineering

Thank you for your interest in joining Contrast Security.

**Your project is to:**

* In auth.ts, read and understand the function `async function _s2s_auth` (line 95)
* Construct a valid authString that would allow the function to succeed and not error out at any time.

**Some notes**

* The Typescript example will not run as-is. There's no need to get it running to work on the project.
* You don't need to actually write code to fulfill this project. A valid authString will do.
* But you're welcome to write code if you want.

Thanks!
